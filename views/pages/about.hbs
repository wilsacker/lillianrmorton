    <div class="about-text">
      <p>For the past five years, I’ve worked as a school psychologist, dedicating my career to helping families navigate the challenges of learning differences. I’m passionate about providing the <strong>guidance and support</strong> needed for children with disabilities, learning challenges, and other obstacles to truly thrive.</p>
      <p>My journey to becoming a psychologist didn’t start in education though. I spent nearly 16 years working as a <strong>criminal defense paralegal</strong>, driven by a deep desire to advocate for others and help them find a way forward. That same passion for helping people overcome challenges led me to my current path.</p>

  <p>A pivotal moment came when my nephew was diagnosed with <strong>autism and ADHD</strong>. I saw firsthand how hard my sister fought to get him the support he needed in school. Sitting alongside her in IEP (Individualized Education Program) meetings, I witnessed the overwhelming challenges of advocating for a child’s unique needs. That experience shaped my commitment to making the process easier for families and sparked my dedication to helping others find <strong>clarity and confidence</strong> through holistic support.</p>
