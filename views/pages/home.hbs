      <h3>I know what it’s like to support a loved one with a disability.</h3>
      <p>When my nephew was struggling in school because of autism and ADHD, my sister faced the same frustration and overwhelm that many parents experience—navigating IEP meetings, advocating for support, and trying to make sense of it all. Being a part of their IEP team shaped my path as an Educational Psychologist.</p>
      <p>With years of experience as a school psychologist and a deep passion for helping families, I provide psychoeducational evaluations, consultations, and counseling to bring clarity, guidance, and confidence to parents and children.</p>
