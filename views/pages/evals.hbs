    <h2>What Is a Psychoeducational Evaluation?</h2>
    <p>A <strong>psychoeducational evaluation</strong> is a <strong>comprehensive assessment</strong> that examines how your child learns and processes information. It provides an in-depth understanding of their:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Academic Achievement:</strong> Reading, writing, and math skills</li>
      <li><strong>Cognitive Abilities:</strong> How the brain processes and retains information</li>
      <li><strong>Social-Emotional and Behavioral Functioning:</strong> How your child interacts at home and school</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="paragraph">The evaluation involves:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reviewing educational records</li>
      <li>Conducting interviews</li>
      <li>Observing your child in various settings</li>
